# AWS project for business uses

This project demonstrates a cloud-based data pipeline using AWS services to ingest,
transform, and analyze e-commerce sales data. I used the github dummyjson repository as data source.

My focus was to solve real life problem: using data to make better decisions.

<br>-I am helping to build a scalable data pipeline to support this need

## Business requirements:
<br>-understand product performance
<br>-analyze customer behaviour
<br>-improve operational and strategic decisions
